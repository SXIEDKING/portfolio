     My name is Saied<br>
    I am 20 <br>  
    I'm from London, originally from Guyana<br>
    I am currently learning to code and have been using different languages such as HTML,CSS and Javascript.
    Learning these languages has been a great experience for me and it broadens my horizons, for example when I think about websites and games I cant help but think about how it was developed fundamentally and how many lines of code there are for the page or game<br>
    I have a ton of hobbies which include coding, but I also enjoy a range of sports from football to basketball and even tennis. Gaming is really up there, it really helps keep my mental health up and its a great relaxer but not for too long of course.
